# Full Load Protocol

In MSL32
 
 * current taxa list was exported to excel
 * that excel was annotated with changes
 * new ICTV Ids were assigned in Excel
 * all that was loaded into "load_next_msl"

In MSL33-33 and 34, a delta only approach was used, with a different [load_next_msl] table schema.
